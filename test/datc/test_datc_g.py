            If a unit is attacked by a supported unit, it is not possible to prevent dislodgement by trying to cut

            First it should be mentioned that if for issue 4.A.3 choice b or c is taken, then the move from Trieste
            to Venice is just a move over land, because the army in Venice is not moving in opposite direction. In that
            case, the support of Venice will not be cut as normal.
            In any other choice for issue 4.A.3, it should be decided whether the Austrian attack is considered to be
            coming from Trieste or from the Adriatic Sea. If it comes from Trieste, the support in Venice is not cut
            and the army in Trieste is dislodged by the fleet in Albania. If the Austrian attack is considered to be
            coming from the Adriatic Sea, then the support is cut and the army in Trieste will not be dislodged. See
            also issue 4.A.4. First of all, I prefer the 1982/2000 rules for adjacent convoying. This means that I
            prefer the move from Trieste uses the convoy. Furthermore, I think that the two Italian units are still
            stronger than the army in Trieste. Therefore, I prefer that the support in Venice is not cut and that the
            army in Trieste is dislodged by the fleet in Albania.
