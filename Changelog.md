Contributors:
- Golden Kumquat

# New Features
- Builds/transforms in Winter will now be marked in red if they have failed
- Variants can now set a custom DPI for map exporting
- `map_width` is now an optional parameter for variants. If it is not set, or set to 0, the map will not wrap around
- Fog of War now works!
  - `.adjudicate full` should not be used; instead use `.publish_fow_moves` and `.publish_fow_order_logs`
  - It is a bad idea to try FoW on large maps with many players, as the bot won't handle sending many maps at once very well
  - Many thanks to the fine folks at the Imperial Diplomacy Bullet Server for getting it to work

# Developer Changes
- Added has_failed to orders done in Winter
- Refactored how orders done in Winter are drawn

# Bugfixes
- Help texts for `.create_press_channel`, `.edit`, and `.edit_game` have been fixed
- The `.servers` command properly works with builds again
- If unit symbols are images, they will now properly copy over to the correct spot on the map

- Games can be created with "chaos" and "fow" parameters
  - Running FoW and Chaos games have not been tested yet and will be implemented in a future patch

# Developer Changes
- Removed temporary Severance code
- Removed vassal/points system that was only used in WoC (and never was fully operational anyway)

1.10.1
=====

Contributors:
- Golden Kumquat

# New Features
- `.setup_server <variant>`, which can be done to create channels and roles in a server for a specific variant.
  - If a role/channel exists, the bot won't try to make a duplicate
  - This requires someone in a "GM Team"/Admin/Moderator role in a GM channel to prevent abuse, as it will create a bunch of channels and roles
- Implemented `.edit transform_unit <province>` to change an army to a fleet or vice-versa
  - `.edit transform_unit <unit_type> <province>` will transform that province's unit to a specific unit type
  - `.edit bulk transform_unit <unit_type> <province1> <province2>...` can transform many units at once to the specified unit type
- Custom variant scripts can return messages that can be sent to `#gm-bot-commands` after adjudication

# Quality of Life
- Players can now do `.vm svg` to get an SVG version of the map
- Added support for aliases in unit types (e.g. "cannon" for armies)
- Added some more SVG support for custom unit types
- If two units support hold each other, and one unit's support is cut, the dashed arrow will be split between red and black to show that one has succeeded and one has failed
- Custom units are now recognised by the order parser (e.g. `Wing London - English Channel` or `B W Paris` would now be successfully parsed)
- If you order a fleet to a province with multiple coasts, but only one that is reachable, the bot will grumble at you but change the destination coast to match (e.g. `Mar - Spa` will get interpreted as `F Marseilles - Spain sc`)

# Developer Changes
- Added a new NoGameError exception to properly handle when someone tries running a command where there's no game
- SVG validation errors are now properly reported
- DiploGM/map_parser/vector/layers.md now has more description of SVG layers

- moved functionality of `get_player_by_role()` into the Manager.
- removed unused `discord_id` property from `Player`.
- moved `get_keywords()`, `_manage_coast_signature()`, `get_unit_type()`, `parse_season()` & `get_value_from_timestamp()` to `sanitise.py`
- moved `get_role_by_player()` into `Player`.
- `Player` now has a reference to its `Board`.
- moved `is_player_channel()` into `perms.py`.
- removed `get_channel_by_player.
- moved `get_player_by_name()` into `Board`.
- moved `get_maps_channel()` and `get_orders_log()` into `game_management.py`

## Other Changes

- Added `assets/*_adjacencies.txt`, `*.pclprof` & `logs/*` and removed `assets/`.
- depreciated `get_latest_board()`.
- `Phase` has been replaced with `Turn`.
- `IMPDIP_SERVER_SUBSTITUTE_LOG_CHANNEL_ID` is no longer a list ( this was breaking `/substitute`).
- `.su_dashboard` now sorts extension list.

# Developer Changes
- Optimised `Manager` initialisation by only loading games for which DiploGM is currently managing (managing a game defined as being a member of the server)
  - Required definition of Manager to occur within `DiploGM.setup_hook`, which must be the first location that `Manager` is called for this functionality
  - This functionality can be reversed at any time by setting the `board_ids` argument in `Manager(board_ids=current_servers)` to `None`
- Created `./bot/core/` directory
  - Created `eventbus.py` to facilitate Event-Driven communication within the codebase
- Created `./diplomacy/core/` directory
  - Created `events.py` to hold Diplomacy Event type definitions (contents minimal)
  - Created `base_listener.py` to define an abstract class for listening and processing of raised Diplomacy Events over the EventBus
- Renamed `ManagerMeta` to `SingletonMeta` and moved to `./bot/core` so that the structure can be reused for other classes
  - Introduced `force_new` boolean argument to create fresh instances (for example when writing tests) 
- Added `get_latest_board()` to `database.py`
  - Added a catch if `Manager.get_board()` fails (no board is currently loaded for that game), `get_latest_board()` attempts to find one on the database. 
- Moved `CommandPermissionError` into new file `errors.py`

## Event Bus
Event Bus is initialised in `setup_hook` as a publish-subscribe observer pattern connector of BaseListener types
It can be accessed within the code base using `bot.eventbus.publish(event)` only Listeners should use the subscribe model

## Event Listeners
An abstract listener is located in `diplomacy/core/base_listener.py`

Custom listeners are currently setup to be created in `diplomacy/listeners` and should feature a type that subclasses the abstract listener, listeners are primarily setup to handle one event, though can be setup to handle multiple if truly desired
An example listener is located in `diplomacy/listeners/event_counter.py`,

# Fun commands
- added `.shutdown`, posts a message.

# GM Changes
These most likely won't be relevant to you unless you're a GM/Angel
- Fixed posting the `.scoreboard csv` to the automatic winter scoreboard output thread. This will stop the errors generated by `.adjudicate`
- Postponed adjudication announcements on `.publish_orders` until an easier method to identify player voids
  - Seems a matter of controversy amongst 'some' of the GMs, but have thus far only heard approval from players.
- Added `bulk` to `.edit`, it allows you to execute `set_core`, `set_province_owner`, `set_province_half_core`, `set_total_owner` to and `delete_unit` a lot of times reducing the amount of copy pasting to edit a big map.
- Added `bulk_create_units` to `.edit`, it allows you to create a lot of units from the same country and type.

# Hellenic Diplomacy
Authored by Con-Pope
- Uploaded modifed config json
  - Added new adjacency and updated starting supply centre counts

# Developer Changes
These most likely won't be relevant to you unless you're a Developer and/or a Superuser.

## Extension Management Cog
Extension management was moved to its own cog to prevent accidental unloading
- New ExtensionManagement Extension and Cog
- `DiploGM.load_extension()`, `DiploGM.reload_extension()` and `DiploGM.unload_extension()` nolonger prepend `bot.cogs.` to extension names when called. This was causing issues, as the base implementation of `reload_extensions` was calling.
- Added wrapper functions `load_diplogm_extension`, `reload_diplogm_extension` & `unload_diplogm_extension` that preprend the extension directory `bot/cogs/` to extension names passed to them.
- Added logging to `DiploGM.reload_extension()` and `DiploGM.unload_extension()`
- `.extension_reload` doesn't list the extension name twice in error messages
- `DiploGM.unload_diplogm_extension` and `DiploGM.reload_diplogm_extension` don't no longer call `load_extionsion` instead of their correct respective functions.
## Other Changes
- Moved superuser list to `config_defaults.toml` and moved `is_superuser` to `perms.py`
- `ScheduleCog.close()` doesn't generate an error message due to calling `.cancel` on a function which isn't a loop anymore

1.0.0
=====
First versioned release - though there has been many prior releases.

# Changelog and repository updates
- Repository moved to https://github.com/Imperial-Diplomacy/DiplomacyGM
- updated README.md with changelog, versioning and release information.
- added `Changelog.md`
- `dev` now acts as a staging branch where PRs should be opened to.


# Hellenic Diplomacy
HellaDip should be fully supported by the bot.
- Support for years before 1 A.D.
- New way of detecting units for Helladip, you now get some fleets.

# GM changes
These most likely won't be relevant to you unless you're a GM/Angel
- `.schedule` will now correctly ping you if an error occurs.

# New Superuser
Golden Kumquat is now a superuser, [per](https://discord.com/channels/1262215477237645314/1262215478072447019/1439753744072970460). Another one to stand up to the tyranny of DiploGM!

# Developer changes
These most likely won't be relevant to you unless you're a Developer and/or a Superuser.

**DEVELOPERS: you will need to create a `config.toml` and put your discord token in it. `.env` has been depreciated.**


## Development Cog
New Cog for developer commands
- `.su_dashboard command` dashboard for the bot - currently only shows loaded extensions and cogs.
- `extension_load`, `extension_unload` & `extension_reload` Can be used to reload extensions and their Cogs.
- `shutdown_the_bot_yes_i_want_to_do_this` command to shutdown the bot.

## Other changes
- Switch to `config.toml` instead of `.env`.
- A lot of hardcoded values have also been moved to `config.toml`.
- Supports logging levels of `CRITICAL` and `INFO` in config.
- Only Extensions in `config.toml` - extensions.load_on_startup are loaded on startup.
- terminology for admin's for the bot have been changed from "bot" to "superuser" to avoid confusion with community admins.
- scheduled commands are saved and deleted from disk instantly.
- commands scheduled in deleted channels are now automatically deleted.
- commands scheduled by users that can't be found are now not run and are deleted.
- scheduled commands now create an artificial Message to invoke a command instead of sending a message to create a new on. This lets superusers schedule superuser commands.
- scheduled commands have better error reporting.
- helladip didn't use the new or old system of unit detection. I didn't want to mess around with the svg so now it checks for what the unit is called in the svg.
- adding logging for SVG -> PNG conversion.
- deleted `_command.py`. Cogs are now stable.
